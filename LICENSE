Tanks is not copyrighted, copylefted, or patented. Tanks is in the Public Domain. You can do whatever you want with it, for whatever purpose (including commerical), without even asking me, to the full extent permitted by law.

It would be awesome if you gave me credit for Tanks if you use it, however, this is not required (as per above).

In jurisdictions where Public Domain does not exist, I grant anyone the right to use this for any purpose without any explicit permission required, to the full extent allowed by law.
